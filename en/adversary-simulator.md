One of the main aspects of cybersecurity training is the purposeful promotion of attacks in order to test the defense systems, a technique called ethical hacking. In this sense, this role in the HackInSDN project will be attributed to the Adversary Simulator Module.

There are many tools which can be used to promote ethical hacking, including:

- D-ITG: Software that emulates Brazilian traffic, and can be used to emulate legitimate traffic; 
- Kali Linux: Linux distribution which includes plenty of security tools, which can be used in the scope of HackInSDN project;
- NMAP: A tool that can be used to emulate network scans and is widely used in ethical hacking;
- Hping3: A tool that can be used to emulate plenty of different attack types, including TCP flood and IP spoofing.
